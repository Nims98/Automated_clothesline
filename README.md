 This repo is a code base for an Embedded System for an Automated Clothesline, a project completed upon the partial fullfilment of the Module [Embedded Systems Design](http://lms.eng.ruh.ac.lk/course/view.php?id=774) offered by [Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna](http://www.eng.ruh.ac.lk/).

This contains two seperate projects, one for the Main Controller and the other for the Power Protection Unit. For the main board, code is written in [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) using [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/Windows) and for the power protection unit, the code is written in [C](https://www.python.org/) using [Atmel Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio).
